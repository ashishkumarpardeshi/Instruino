# Instruino
Instruino (making instruments using Arduino)  is (one of the DIY Lab Instruments) a common platform for multiple sensors. It provide measurements of parameters such as pH, Turbidity, Temperature of liquid, Humidity, ambient Temperature and Light Intensity. Basically it is an IOT device capable of sending data to internet via WiFi and also contains bluetooth and SD Card for logging facility. The complete setup is done on half size drawing board with casing (the electronics) and other 3D printed part on it.
Instruino is designed and developed as a DIY Lab Instrument for schools/colleges biology and chemistry labs. Students, Teachers and Researcher can make their own instruino.
It used Arduino Mega board and following sensors:
  1. Dfrobots pH Probe Sensor
  2. Dfrobots Turbidity Sensor
  3. DS18b20
  4. DHT22
  5. BH1750
